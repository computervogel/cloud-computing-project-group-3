# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler

## Definition and Scope
The project consists of a small self-built website with 3-4 services. These services will be autoscaled using a horizontal/vertical pod autoscaler. Testing will be done by hand or if possible by a loadgenerator. Through logs we will be able to check the resource allocation/number of pods. If enough time is left we try to implement a multidimensional autoscaler. Main resource will probably be: https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler

## Milestones
-Design the website

-Deploy the working website

-Research autoscaling (Tools and Concepts)

-Implement the autoscalers
